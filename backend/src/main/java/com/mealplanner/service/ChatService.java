            "To manage your weight effectively, focus on creating a sustainable calorie deficit through a combination of healthy eating and regular exercise. Aim for a balanced diet rich in whole foods, lean proteins, vegetables, and healthy fats. Remember, gradual changes are more sustainable than drastic diets.",
            "Weight management is about balance. Focus on portion control, regular physical activity, and choosing nutrient-dense foods. Track your progress but don't obsess over the scale - how you feel is just as important!",
            "Sustainable weight management involves lifestyle changes, not quick fixes. Eat mindfully, stay hydrated, get adequate sleep, and find physical activities you enjoy. Small, consistent changes lead to lasting results."

        // Protein and muscle building
        responseMap.put("protein", new String[]{
            "Protein is essential for muscle building and repair. Good sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, and dairy. Aim for 0.8-1.2g of protein per kg of body weight daily, or 1.6-2.2g if you're actively building muscle.",
            "Excellent protein sources include chicken breast, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, beans, lentils, and quinoa. Try to include protein in every meal to support muscle maintenance and recovery.",
            "For muscle building, spread your protein intake throughout the day. Include 20-30g of protein in each meal. Don't forget that timing matters - consuming protein within 2 hours after exercise can help with muscle recovery."

        // Vitamins and supplements
        responseMap.put("vitamin", new String[]{

            "Aim to eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables to get a variety of vitamins and minerals naturally. Dark leafy greens, citrus fruits, berries, and colorful vegetables are excellent sources of essential nutrients.",

            "Meal planning saves time and helps you make healthier choices. Start by planning 3-4 meals per week, prep ingredients in advance, and keep healthy snacks readily available. Remember to include variety to ensure you get all necessary nutrients.",
            "When meal planning, think about the plate method: half vegetables, quarter lean protein, quarter whole grains. This simple approach helps create balanced, nutritious meals without overthinking."

        responseMap.put("calorie", new String[]{

            "Your calorie needs depend on your age, activity level, and goals. Use online calculators as a starting point, but listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Quality of food is just as important as quantity.",

            "Healthy eating is about balance and consistency. Include a variety of whole foods, stay hydrated, eat mindfully, and don't deprive yourself. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.",
            "Build healthy eating habits gradually. Start with small changes like adding more vegetables to your meals, drinking more water, or cooking at home more often. Small steps lead to big changes over time.",
            "Healthy eating doesn't mean giving up your favorite foods. It's about making better choices most of the time and enjoying treats in moderation. Focus on adding nutritious foods rather than just removing 'bad' ones."

        // Exercise and nutrition
        responseMap.put("exercise", new String[]{
            "Nutrition and exercise work together for optimal health. Fuel your workouts with carbohydrates before exercise and protein after. Stay hydrated and listen to your body's needs.",
            "Your nutrition needs change based on your activity level. Active individuals may need more calories, protein, and carbohydrates. Time your meals around your workouts for better performance and recovery.",
